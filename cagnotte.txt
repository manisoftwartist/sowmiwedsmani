Thanks to all the kind ones who have been asking me so many times about the wedding gift.  

Instead of a traditional list of things, a moneypot gives us more flexibility and choice about the gifts. With a single click, you can participate. And you are welcome to contribute whatever amount you wish to.

How will the money you give be used? Here is our vision of how to spend this moneypot.

 - 50% to a good cause

Half of this moneypot we want to offer it to an old age home (maison de retraite) that my family personally knows. The people in this home are not there by choice but rather because they were abandoned by their families, which is sad! Furthermore, these people do not have a pension or retirement amount of any kind. This money will sponsor the expenses towards food for these elderly, less fortunate people for a certain number of days (depending on the amount). I have attached some photos from when my dad took our family there on my parents' wedding day in 2012. We managed to get them excellent dishes prepared for the whole day. And the happiness on their faces - simply priceless! Sowmika and me want to do this again.

- 50% for a dream trip

The second half will help cement our budget for a dream honeymoon trip. Sowmika and me hope to escape to an island far away (with absolutely no network connectivity of any kind) and stay there for a week. 

Thank you all and hope to see you all soon!
